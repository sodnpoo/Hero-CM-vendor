In order to compile Cyanogen

1. cd to your-cyanogen-source/vendor/htc

2. git clone git@github.com:maxisma/Hero-CM-vendor.git hero

3. edit vendor/cyanogen/vendorsetup.sh by adding a new line:
add_lunch_combo cyanogen_hero-eng

4. edit vendor/cyanogen/products/AndroidProducts.mk and add a new line:
         $(LOCAL_DIR)/cyanogen_hero.mk \

*You will need to remove the line that contains cyanogen_supersonic until it is fully included in the repository

5. copy vendor/htc/hero/added_files/cyanogen_hero.mk to vendor/cyanogen/products/

6. push your favourite boot animation to vendor/htc/hero/media/

7. execute vendor/htc/hero/extract-files.sh to copy proprietary and prebuilt files from your current rom

8. put your favourite kernel in vendor/htc/prebuilt. Make sure it is named "kernel".

9. execute ". ./build/envsetup.sh"

10. execute "lunch" and choose "cyanogen_hero-eng"

11. make :)
